# Build a Transformer Model (LLM) with PyTorch

This project provides a step-by-step guide to build a simple transformer-based language model (LLM) using PyTorch and Streamlit. The application allows users to define model parameters, preprocess data, train the model, evaluate it, and download the trained model.

## Features

- Define model parameters (embedding size, number of attention heads, number of encoder and decoder layers).
- Load and preprocess data for training.
- Train the transformer model.
- Evaluate the model with user input.
- Download the trained model.
- Additional functionalities using Hugging Face Pipelines (Masked Language Modeling and Feature Extraction).

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit application in your default web browser.

## Files

- **app.py**: The main application script that defines the Streamlit UI and functionalities.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python packages required to run the application.
- **README.md**: This file, providing information about the project.
- **.gitignore**: Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.
